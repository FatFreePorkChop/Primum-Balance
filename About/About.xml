	<description>
		Provides largely mathematical fixes to a number of things in rimworld including:
			Surgery success chances
				In vanilla, surgery success hard caps at 95%.
				In PB, surgery success keeps on going up.
			Product quality
				In vanilla, product quality (eg. from construction, crafting, or art) is determined by: relevent skill and modifiers to quality, such as production specialists or inspiration.
				In PB, quality is generally decreased so that good and excellent items are significantly less common. Further, acheiving a masterwork or legendary result requires artistic skill as well.
